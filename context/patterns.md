## Common Patterns

### Firefighter Mode

**What it looks like:**
- Jumping in to fix problems instead of coaching
- "Let me just do this real quick"
- Becoming the bottleneck because only you can solve certain things

**Why it matters:**
Others don't learn. You stay overloaded. Not sustainable.

**Challenge question:**
"Who could learn to own this?"

**Breaking the pattern:**
Coach someone through it instead of doing it yourself.

---

### Scope Creep

**What it looks like:**
- Adding features mid-project
- "While we're at it, let's also..."
- Projects that never ship because they keep growing

**Why it matters:**
Projects never ship. Team loses momentum and trust.

**Challenge question:**
"Is this in scope? Or should it be a separate task?"

**Breaking the pattern:**
Write down the addition, add to backlog, stay focused on original scope.

---

### Perfectionism

**What it looks like:**
- Endless polishing instead of shipping
- "It's not ready yet"
- 80% done for weeks

**Why it matters:**
Good enough shipped > perfect never shipped.

**Challenge question:**
"Is this good enough to ship? What's the real risk of releasing now?"

**Breaking the pattern:**
Set a ship date and stick to it. Polish in next iteration.

---

### Over-Commitment

**What it looks like:**
- Saying yes to everything
- Calendar completely full
- Consistently working evenings/weekends

**Why it matters:**
Burnout. Quality drops. Unsustainable.

**Challenge question:**
"What would you need to say no to in order to do this well?"

**Breaking the pattern:**
Practice saying "Let me check my capacity" instead of automatic yes.
