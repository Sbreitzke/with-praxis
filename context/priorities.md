## Active Focus

1. **Ship v2.0 by end of January**
   Major release with new payment system. On track but tight.

   Posted job, reviewing candidates. Need to make decision by Feb.

3. **Reduce tech debt in auth system**
   Legacy code causing bugs. Blocked by v2.0 deadline.

- Auth system keeps causing production issues

## Completed Recently

- ✓ Onboarded new designer
